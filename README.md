# VUEJS PROJECT : HERO'S FIRST STEP ü¶∏

## WHAT IS THIS PROJECT ? ‚öôÔ∏è

This lab allows you to create your first vuejs project with vue-cli and to understand the general organization of a SPA application created via vue-cli.
The setting is role-playing oriented, with towns, streets and shops where adventurers can buy items and then assign them to parts of themselves.

This lab also allows you to discover some basic elements of the vuejs syntax by writing some simple components.
